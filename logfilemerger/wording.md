Assumptions:

1) After merging the files, I arranged the records in the output file in a chronological order thus changing the original records creation sequence file wise.
2) Logger class could have been kept in a common class but it was not necessary for this project.
2) Unit test was omitted considering the goal of this activity.
3) Google Guava library was used for multimap functionality since usage of third party APIs was never explicitly restricted in this exercise.


Hope you like it :-)
